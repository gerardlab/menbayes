Description: Provides a suite of methods for Bayesian tests for
    Mendelian segregation in experimental polyploid populations (right
    now just for tetraploids). This is under different assumptions of
    meiosis. This material is based upon work supported by the
    National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2132247.  The
    opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed
    are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views
